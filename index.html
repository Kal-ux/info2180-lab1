        <h2>Rashede Callum</h2> 
        <p> I am driven in life to push forward, ignore and override. I aspire to be the best and better, to be a jack of all trades, not to gloat nor boast, but to be of service to many. I strive for perfection, knowing it is a land no man has been. I enjoy basketball, NFL, anime and graphic artistry. I chose web development as I believe it is a good skill to have and I am looking forward to how much this course can teach me. Always willing to learn </p>
